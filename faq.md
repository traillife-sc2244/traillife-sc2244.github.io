<summary><strong><u>When / where does Troop SC-2244 meet?</u></strong></summary>
Troop SC-2244 is chartered with East Pickens Baptist Church, a Southern Baptist Church located on Gentry Memorial Hwy between Pickens and Easley, SC. <a href="www.eastpickens.org" target="_blank">EastPickens.org</a>
<br /><br />
The troop meets every Thursday night from 6:15 - 8:00 for regular troop meetings. During these meetings the trailmen participate in a devotional time and work towards earning branches or badges for the various troop levels through instructional and hands-on activities. Each second Thursday of the month the trailmen focus on the Worthy Life Award, the spiritual development component of Trail Life USA.
<br /><br />
On certain dates throughout the program year the troop also holds Hit the Trail events. These events are typically off-campus and are posted on our calendar.
<br /><br />
*Navigators and Adventurers continue to meet during the summer to work on badges. Woodland Trails meet throughout the school year but do not meet during summer months.

<summary><strong><u>How much does Trail Life USA cost?</u></strong></summary>
Yearly membership dues are $30.70 per boy. This is paid directly to the national organization and covers liability insurance for the variety of activities we plan and host each year. The troop also has yearly dues of $25 per trailman, with a family max of $50 per year. Dues are required to be paid upon joining the troop.
<br /><br />
Yearly membership dues for registered adults are $35.68 and include insurance coverage for events, a background check, and Child Protection Safety Training.  We do not require all parents to register in order for their boys to be in the troop, but in order to volunteer with the troop or serve in any leadership capacity they must go through this process. This is to further ensure the safety of every boy in the troop.
<br /><br />
In addition to membership fees, each troop member will need to purchase a uniform shirt, which is also available directly from TLUSA, at a cost of approx $50.  We do not ask you to do that until you have been able to attend a few meetings and are sure that TLUSA is a good fit for your son. We will also provide an opportunity to place your order in the fall as part of a large group order in order to reduce shipping costs.

<summary><strong><u>Are non-Christians allowed to join TLUSA?</u></strong></summary>
Our Member policy allows for boys of any faith (or no faith at all) to participate in the program of Trail Life USA.
<br /><br />
Local Charter Organizations satisfy the specific ministry goals of their church or organization. In some cases, that may be as an outreach ministry to boys in the community. In other cases, that may be as an in-reach ministry specifically to minister to the families or members of the local church or organization. Therefore, individual Charter Organizations may have more specific membership requirements that limit Troop membership to boys of a certain faith or membership in a certain organization.

<summary><strong><u>How does faith play into the TLUSA program?</u></strong></summary>
As a Christ-centered organization, our faith is woven throughout the program without being necessarily “religious” or “churchy.” From faith-building options in the advancement program, outdoor worship, to more in-depth discipleship opportunities, adult and youth members receive biblical instruction and training in biblical faith. As iron sharpens iron, so too will boys sharpen the faith of their peers. Adult Christian leaders will guide youth in the development of their faith and moral decision-making, as well as sharpen the faith of their adult peers.
