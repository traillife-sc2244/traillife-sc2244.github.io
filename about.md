## __Who We Are__
### Troop SC-2244 - Raising Godly Boys
More than ever, boys need a uniquely masculine program where their assertive, audacious, and adventurous nature is celebrated, not sequestered.
Too many boys are turning to virtual worlds to find realms they can conquer and areas where they can excel. The result of this virtual conquest is apathy, apparent rebellion, or outright resistance to real-world challenge.

__Trail Life USA is an environment where boys thrive!__ Adults are equipped to lead a program in a structured outdoor environment where boys are engaged in real-world challenge and experience camping, hiking, and fishing; they develop skills in riflery, archery, and canoeing; and learn character and leadership in a practical hands-on manner that is naturally engaging.

Boys find mentors, fathers and sons connect, important relationships are fostered, and boys find opportunity to achieve significant accomplishment.

"Be watchful, stand firm in the faith, act like men, be strong."
-- â€‹__1 Corinthians 16:13__
