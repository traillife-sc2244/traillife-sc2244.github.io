## __Who We Are__

### Troop SC-2244 - Raising Godly Young Men

Trail Life USA partners with churches and parents across America as the premier national character development organization for young men which produces the next generation of godly and responsible husbands, fathers, and citizens.

__Trail Life USA is an environment where boys thrive!__ Adults are equipped to lead a program in a structured outdoor environment where boys are engaged in real-world challenge and experience camping, hiking, and fishing; they develop skills in riflery, archery, and canoeing; and learn character and leadership in a practical hands-on manner that is naturally engaging.

Boys find mentors, important relationships are fostered, fathers and sons connect, and boys find opportunities to achieve significant accomplishment.

"Be watchful, stand firm in the faith, act like men, be strong."
-- â€‹__1 Corinthians 16:13__
