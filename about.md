## __Who We Are__

### Troop SC-2244 - Raising Godly Young Men

Trail Life USA partners with churches and parents across America as the premier national character development organization for young men which produces the next generation of godly and responsible husbands, fathers, and citizens.

__Trail Life USA is an environment where boys thrive!__ Adults are equipped to lead a program in a structured, outdoor environment where boys are engaged in real-world challenges as they experience outdoor activities such as camping, hiking, and fishing. They develop skills in riflery, archery, and canoeing; and they develop character and leadership through practical, real-world experiences that are naturally engaging and increasingly challenging.

Fathers and sons connect, boys find mentors, peer relationships are formed and Godly community is developed as boys develop strength of body, soul and spirit, encouraging each other to become Godly men who serve one another, their community, and their country.

"Be watchful, stand firm in the faith, act like men, be strong."
-- â€‹__1 Corinthians 16:13__
