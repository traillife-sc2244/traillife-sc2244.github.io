## Fiscal Responsibility

Each Trail Life troop is owned and operated by its local church, functioning under the financial oversight and support of that congregation.

## Support

In alignment with our national organization, we are committed to being debt-averse and primarily supported by our members.

The majority of our annual funding is provided through member dues and fundraising activities. The most meaningful way to support our troop is by joining and actively participating in our community.
