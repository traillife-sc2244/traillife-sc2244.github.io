## Welcome

Our goal in Troop 2244 is to develop Godly young men in the Pickens area that will influence our community and world for many years to come. We do that through teaching young men what a Godly man looks like based on strong Biblical principles and through teaching real-world skills that they will take with them for the rest of their lives.

> **1 Corinthians 16:13**<br />

## Trail Life USA: Christ-Centered, Boy-Focused

Trail Life USA is a Church-Based, Christ-Centered, Boy-Focused mentoring and discipleship journey that speaks to the heart of a boy. Established on timeless values derived from the Bible and set in the context of outdoor adventure, boys are engaged in a Troop setting by male mentors where they are challenged to grow in character, understand their purpose, serve their community, and develop practical leadership skills.

> "There are many qualities which we need in order to gain success, but the three above all—for the lack of which no brilliancy and no genius can atone—are Courage, Honesty and Common Sense."
>
> **- President Teddy Roosevelt**
